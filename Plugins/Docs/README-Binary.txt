Installing an ARMSim# plugin is a simple 2 step process:

1) Open the .zip file and copy all the files into the Installation directory
   of the ARMSim.

Default is:  "C:\Program Files\University of Victoria\ARMSim.192"
   or        "C:\Program Files (x86)\University of Victoria\ARMSim.192" (for 64 bit Windows)

2) Start ARMSim# and select File -> Preferences. Select the Plugins tab and check the box
   for the plugin you wish to enable. (Un-check any plugins you do not wish loaded)


   If the plugin has a user interface component you can display it by enabling the Plugins UI
   by selecting View -> PluginsUI
